# Dog Breed Classifier

## Description

This project is the second project of the _Deep Learning nanodegree_, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** ([https://eu.udacity.com](https://eu.udacity.com/)), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

The project objective is to create and train a deep learning algorithm that can  detect the presence or absence of a dog in an image, Detect and classifythe breed of the dog if present and if given the image of a person, classify the closest resembling dog breed.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:

-   The file  _**dog_app.ipynb**_, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
-   The folder  _uploaded_, which contains the images used during evaluation.
-   The file  _report.html_, which is a web page that contains the details of the project

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the deep learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to  **PyTorch**  ([https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)), the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by  **Facebook**  and its  **FAIR**  (Facebook AI Research) team ([https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/)).
